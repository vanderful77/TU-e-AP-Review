# TU-e-AP-Review
I'm a first-year student studying Applied Physics in Technology University of Eindhoven. Particularly, I'm doing a challenging experience because I'm taking extra courses and preparing for double majoring in physics and CSE, and I enjoyed the high density of knowledge so far. Therefore, I always want to make a summary of everything I've done, so that it offers as an example of how you can make the a lot use of TU/e.

This project was inspired by [diemop/awesome-tue-software: ðŸ“š TU/e software science bachelor awesome list - notes, links, summaries](https://github.com/diemop/awesome-tue-software). This is a very well-intended list and ignited my passion on documenting university life as well, though sadly the author stopped the project after the first year.
