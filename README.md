# TU/e Applied Physics Review
I'm a first-year student studying Applied Physics in Technology University of Eindhoven. Particularly, I'm doing a challenging experience because I'm taking extra courses and preparing for double majoring in physics and CSE, and I enjoyed the high density of knowledge so far. Therefore, I always want to make a summary of everything I've done, so that it offers as an example of how you can make the a lot use of TU/e.

This project was inspired by [diemop/awesome-tue-software: ðŸ“š TU/e software science bachelor awesome list - notes, links, summaries](https://github.com/diemop/awesome-tue-software). This is a very well-intended list and ignited my passion on documenting university life as well, though sadly the author stopped the project after the first year.

# Year 1

General impression: The curriculum was arranged that in each quartile, there is roughly one math course, one physics course and one experiment course. The theoretical content of this year is a recap of high school physics and mathematics, basically. The experimental content, on the other hand, is tougher and requires more attention. From the experimental courses, you're expected to convey experiments whose contents you only read from the manuals, write journals and reports, carry out error analysis, do MATLAB and python programming, and in Q4, design a experiment on your own.

## Quartile 1

#### Introduction to Applied Physics [31IAP]

**Impression**

Named introduction to applied physics, but contains nothing about physics (just kidding). In fact it teaches how to convey dimensional analysis, ordinary differential equations, stability of equilibriums and a bit of phase diagrams. It's a comprehensive course that discusses how physics can be analyzed without being "physical".
